<!-- Documents having test/html media type are parsed using HTML rules -->
<!-- Documents transimitted with an HTML content type is processed as an HTML document by web browsers -->
<!-- The html file is opened usuing DOM tree accessor, which open your file like tree with heriachical structure -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- The DOCTYPE is declaration tag that represents the document type -->
<!-- The html value represents the version of html(usually html5) rather than real data type -->
<!-- PS. there is also another type called xhtml, you can think it as a combination of xml and html with extra tags -->
<!-- In XHTML the sytax rules are more strict(all tags in lowercase and sytax error will crash the entire docuemnt) -->
<html>
<!-- The HTML tag is the root element of the tree and contains all html element except the doctype tag -->

            In this module, you learned that:
        <ul>
            <li>Front-end developers work on the parts of the website or app that the user sees and interact with.
            </li>
            <li>
                Back-end developers work on the logic and functionality that keeps the website or app running and
                responding
                to users’ inputs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Full-stack developers have both sets of skills.
            </li>
            <li>
                Front-end developers and back-end developers work closely together.
            </li>
            <li>
                Frameworks and libraries extend the functionality of coding languages such as JavaScript and Python.
            </li>
            <li>
                Common languages for front-end development include: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            </li>
            <li>
                Common languages and frameworks for back-end development include: Python, Django, and Flask.
            </li>
            <li>
                Version control systems keep track of changes and resolve conflicts between them.
            </li>
            <li>
                CI/CD (Continuous Integration with Continuous Delivery/Deployment) is a best practice developers use to
                deliver frequent changes reliably.

        <h3 id='section'>HTML scripting</h3>
        <p>
            <a>
                This is the paragraph for HTML scripting example.
            </a>
            <input type='text' id='textField1'>
            <!-- The id attribute is helping the script to search for the value given -->
            <input type='button' onClick='textChecker()' value='Submit'>
            <!-- This is the button to wake up the funtion, the attribute onClick is the funtion to call and value is the text on button -->
        </p>
        <h3>HTML input type support</h3>
        <p>
            This is the paragraph to introcude the browser support for ccs3 and html5<br>
            <!-- the tag <br> is used to break the line. -->
            Goggle Chrome supports most features, but other browsers or the older versions of browsers may not support
            the
            newest features.<br>
            The <a href='https://www.caniuse.com' target='_blank'> caniuse.com</a> provides support tables for HTML5 and
            CSS3, if you are
            interested.
            <!-- <a href='some value'></a> is how you insert hyperlinks, target='_blank' means open the page in a new tab -->
        </p>
        <p>
            Each brower would have different implementations for web functions, for example:
        </p>
        <input type='date'>
        <p>
            If you see a text field. it means the data type is not supported by the
            browser and you may need to created the input function by yourself or using other ways to input the value
            you
            want.<br>
            This would interfere your validation process and the input may varies.<br>
            You can also test whether the data type is supported using your codes.
            functions are in the source file.
        </p>
        <p id='thisform'>
            <input type='button' onClick='testElementSuport()' value='test element support for date'>
        </p>
        <h3>Other tags for html</h3>
        <p>
            The &lt;a href='#top'&gt;
            <!-- &lt;&gt; The function to represent special characters may varies. (I see IBM use text writer to do the whole class of shits.) you can use &lt; to represent < tag -->
            tag can be used to bring you to other pages or bring you to
            <a href='#top'>the top of the page</a> or <a href='#section'>other sections.</a> You may resize the window
            to
            see how it works.
        </p>
        <p>
            The &lt;ol&gt; tag can be used to create an ordered list while the &lt;ul&gt; can be used to create
            unordered
            list.
            <!-- Unordered List -->
        <ul>
            <li>This is a bullet point </li>
            <li>The items in this list have no particular order </li>
            <li>Each item will appear as a bullet, rather than a number </li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Ordered List -->
        <ol>
            <li>This is an ordered list </li>
            <li>The items in this list have a particular order </li>
            <li>Each item will be numbered, starting from 1 </li>
            <li>This is the fourth point in the list </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            The &lt;table&gt; tag can also help you to create a table. but you may need additional css to make the table
            looks better.
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Heading 1</th>
