        Hi, I'm Haolin (Gary) Guo <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f44b.png" width="60px" />
      </h1>
      <p>
        I am Gary, a Generation Z who aspires to utilize my knowledge and skills in the field of science and technology
        to conquer a brighter future for people and society, where my sympathy genuinely lies in. As I delve into
        historical studies, I came to understand diverse groups of people and societies, develop a unique sense of
        identity, which created a sense of appreciation of the present and an eager desire to spread gospels in our
        turbulent society. With years of experience in computer science, including algorithm design, website
        development, database systems, and machine learning, I am able to utilize the frontier technology of digital
        humanities to preserve valuable gifts of remnants of our ancestors and draw public attention to issues regarding
        justice and equality. I hope that my knowledge will add a thin layer to the heroic bulwark against miseries that
        mankind suffers from.

        Gary is the smartest student I have ever meet. Working with Gary has been an awesome experience. He is highly
        knowledgable and always goes the extra step to make sure everything is right. But he still doesn't give me offer to Google.
